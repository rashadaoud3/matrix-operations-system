# Real-Time Matrix Operations System

A multi-processing application for matrix operations using Pipes, Signals, and OpenMP under Linux.

## 📋 Project Description
This project implements a real-time matrix operations system that uses multiple processes, inter-process communication (pipes), signal handling, and parallel processing (OpenMP) to perform various matrix operations.

## 🚀 Features
- **Matrix Operations**: Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication
- **Advanced Calculations**: Determinant, Eigenvalues & Eigenvectors
- **Multi-Processing**: Process pools for parallel computation
- **Inter-Process Communication**: Pipes for data transfer
- **Signal Handling**: Proper cleanup and resource management
- **OpenMP Integration**: Parallel processing for large matrices
- **File I/O**: Save/load matrices from files

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- C Programming Language
- Linux System Calls
- Pipes (IPC)
- Signals
- OpenMP (Parallel Processing)
- Multi-Processing
